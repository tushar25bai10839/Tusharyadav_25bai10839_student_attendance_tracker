Project Report: Tkinter-Based Calculator Application

1. Introduction

This project is a simple Python-based calculator built using Tkinter. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, along with square and square-root functions. The main aim is to create a clean, easy-to-use GUI while practicing event handling and class-based coding in Python.

2. Objectives

Build a user-friendly calculator interface.

Implement basic arithmetic and special operations (x², √x).

Add keyboard support for faster use.

Maintain clean, modular, class-based code.


3. Tools & Technologies

Language: Python

GUI Framework: Tkinter

IDE: VS Code / PyCharm / IDLE

OS: Windows, Mac, Linux


4. System Requirements

Hardware: 2GB RAM, dual-core CPU, 50MB storage

Software: Python 3.x with Tkinter


5. Project Description

The project uses a Calculator class that manages the display, buttons, expressions, and event handling. The UI includes digit buttons, operators, C (clear), square, square-root, and equals. The interface is clean, minimal, and keyboard-friendly.

6. Working Principle

Display: Two labels—one for total expression, one for current input.

Buttons: Digits append numbers; operators update the expression; “=” evaluates using eval(); C resets; x² and √x apply transformations.

Keyboard: Supports digits, operators, and Enter key.


7. Code Structure

Major methods include: __init__, create_display_frame, create_buttons_frame, create_digit_buttons, create_operator_buttons, evaluate, add_to_expression, append_operator, update_label, run.

8. UI Layout

Uses grid layout (5×4). Digits arranged like a real calculator, operators aligned vertically, and “=” spans multiple columns. Color theme is soft and clean.

9. Advantages

Simple, fast, cross-platform

Keyboard support

Clean UI

Beginner-friendly and extendable


10. Limitations

Uses eval()

No parentheses

No scientific functions

No backspace or advanced validation


11. Future Enhancements

Add %, parentheses, backspace, themes

Add scientific functions

Add history panel


12. Conclusion

This Tkinter Calculator project successfully demonstrates GUI development using Python. It is simple, functional, and provides a strong base for building more advanced calculators or GUI applications.
